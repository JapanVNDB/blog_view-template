## :sparkling_heart: Support my projects

This project will be Open Source and will be available to the public with their respective updates. Since it will be actively working offering quality translations of each of your favorite visual novels.

However, if you get any benefit out of this or just want to encourage me to keep creating things, there are a few ways you can do it:
- Starring and sharing the projects you like :rocket:
- [![PayPal][badge_paypal]][paypal-donations] You can make one-time donations via PayPal. I'll probably buy a ~~coffee~~ tea. :tea:
- [![Support me on Patreon][badge_patreon]][patreon] Set up a recurring monthly donation and you will get interesting concept art images (things that I don't share with everyone). :smiley:
